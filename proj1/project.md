To understand the problem and the structure of the project, we will use a simple client-server 
application to demonstrate socket programming.

1 - The client reads a line of characters (data) from its keyboard and sends the data to
the server;

2 - The server receives the data and converts the characters to uppercase;

3 - The server sends the modified data to the client;

4 - The client receives the modified data and displays the line on its screen.

First step: create a client and a server that communicates using sockets.
